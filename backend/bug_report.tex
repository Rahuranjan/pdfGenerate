            \large The CVSS score provided in this report is meant to serve as a tool to assist with the prioritizing
            vulnerability resolution. This score, however, does not take into consideration the context of the
            business. For some business IT contexts some lower-scored vulnerabilities could have serious
            business impact. Hence, all of the reported vulnerabilities should be taken into consideration.

            \subsection{\large How to use this report}

            \large The vulnerabilities reported in this document provide a view of the target of evaluation's security posture
            at the time of testing. This timeframe, "at the time of testing", is important to highlight because the report
            cannot address future changes to the target of evaluation, changes in the systems that support the target of evaluation and emerging, publicly disclosed exploits that could have an impact on the target
            of evaluation.

            \large The goal of this document is to provide input to help identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities that were
            detected at the time of testing and to provide some guidance as to how the vulnerabilities might be
            mitigated.

                \normalsize Status & \normalsize This field will contain either "Verified" or "Detected". If this value is "Verified", then the tester exploited this vulnerability during the penetration test. If it is "Detected",
                then evidence of the vulnerability was found, but it was not exploited during testing. There are many reasons why a tester may not be able to exploit a vulnerability
                during testing. Examples include threat of system instability after exploit, lack of time during testing and/or inability to find a vector by which a vulnerability could be exploited.  \\

            \large The report is broken up into three major sections: an executive summary, a technical detail report and an appendix. The executive summary will provide a high-level overview of the vulnerabilities detected
            during the penetration test.

            \large The technical detail report will provide the details of the vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test. Each vulnerability will include the following descriptors.
            
            \large The appendix will contain information about the testing environment and further details gathered during testing that do not fit within the first three chapters. 
            This information is necessary to have a complete picture of the penetration test, but it is in the appendix to make accessing the testing results more userfriendly.

                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A01:2021-Broken Access Control} & 
                \normalsize Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended
                permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification,
                or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures} & 
                \normalsize Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, Cryptographic Failures involve protecting
                data in transit and at rest. This includes passwords, credit card numbers, health records,
                personal information, and business secrets that require extra protection, especially if that
                data falls under privacy. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A03:2021-Injection} & 
                \normalsize Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, XXE, XSS and LDAP injection occur when untrusted
                data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data
                can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without
                proper authorization. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A04:2021-Insecure Design (Currently out of scope) } & 
                \normalsize Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as
                "missing or ineffective control design." Secure design is a culture and methodology that
                constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to
                prevent known attack methods. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration} & 
                \normalsize Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of
                insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage,
                misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive
                information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications
                be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components} & 
                \normalsize Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always
                run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate
                serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known
                vulnerabilities may undermine application defences and enable a range of possible attacks
                and impacts. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A07:2021- Identification and Authentication Failures} & 
                \normalsize Application functions related to authentication and session management are often
                implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session
                tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
                (temporarily or permanently). \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures (Currently out of scope)} & 
                \normalsize Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect
                against integrity violations. This new category is making assumptions related to software
                updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures} & 
                \normalsize Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with
                incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot
                to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to
                detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal
                processes or monitoring. \\
                \hline
                \normalsize \textbf{A10:2021-ServerSide Request Forgery(SSRF)} & 
                \normalsize SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without
                validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a
                crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or
                another type of network access control list (ACL). \\
